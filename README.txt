* gdm needs to be a real user (with shell) in order to start up uiserver in greeter. Otherwise, socket creation fails.
* gdm's metacity needs to be started with --composite option
* GTK+3 maintains IM cache here: /usr/lib/gtk-3.0/3.0.0/immodules.cache

== TODO ==
* Install schema files for the gdm user/session?
* Install a metacity.desktop file to replace
** Could we use a metacity-add-compositing.desktop which uses metacity --replace instead of overwriting the original file?
